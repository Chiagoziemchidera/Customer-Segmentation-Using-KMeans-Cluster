# Customer-Segmentation-Using-KMeans-Cluster
---
##Project Overview##

ShopEase, established in 2017, is a fast-growing e-commerce platform and supermarket chain that offers a wide range of products including clothing, groceries, sportswear, electronics, and home & garden essentials. Despite its rapid expansion, ShopEase has only scratched the surface of leveraging its customer data for strategic decision-making.
With years of data collected from its loyalty program, sales records, and customer demographics, ShopEase embarked on a customer segmentation project. This project aims to analyze customer behavior and create actionable segments to personalize marketing campaigns, enhance customer engagement, and drive retention. By clustering customers based on their age, income, spending habits, and loyalty metrics like membership years and purchase frequency, ShopEase is poised to optimize its marketing strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.
